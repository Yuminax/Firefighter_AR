# Firefighter_AR

This project was created and developed for my Bachelor. The purpose is to improve the firefighter's
Training thanks to the augmented reality.


# Resume
Firefighter training is often expensive in terms of materials and personnel. During search and
rescue training, there needs to be a stock of ready to use training dummies, as well as multiple
people to serve as security and safety personnel. The instructors must go back and forth to
place the dummies in the training area. The culmination of these trips for all the participating
groups leads to a considerable loss of valuable time. Furthermore, once the dummies have
been found, the only option is to return the dummy back to the start of the training area.

Thanks to this bachelor project, firefighter training courses will be more diversified thanks to
the help of augmented reality. The holograms allow for a faster deployment of the dummies,
these now being virtual and the headset allowing for greater interaction and personalisation.
Une explanatory panel can be added to the hologram to specify certain situations and require
the participant to react accordingly. The augmented reality opens the door for newer infinite
possibilities, we are only at the start of this very promising technology.
